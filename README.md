# Rust Asynchronous Runtime Framework

This project implements an asynchronous runtime framework in Rust. It provides the core functionalities needed to create and manage asynchronous tasks, allowing for efficient execution and scheduling.

## Overview

The Rust Asynchronous Runtime Framework consists of several components:

- **Runtime**: Manages the execution of tasks and scheduling.
- **Executor**: Runs the tasks and handles their state transitions.
- **Task**: Represents a unit of work that can be executed asynchronously.
- **Waker**: Notifies the runtime when a task is ready to be polled again.

## Usage

To use the asynchronous runtime framework, include it as a dependency in your `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
[dependencies]
rust-async-runtime = { path = "path/to/rust-async-runtime" }
```

### Example

A simple example of using the framework can be found in the `examples/basic.rs` file. This example demonstrates how to create and run tasks using the runtime.

## Running Tests

Integration tests are included in the `tests/integration_tests.rs` file. You can run the tests using the following command:

```bash
cargo test
```
